# packages.yml
#
# packages.yml defines all the packages we are able to build for a single commit
# in this repo. A package means a single zip file containing the executable binary,
# and optionally other files if needed.
#
# packages.yml is a convenience file for the human management of large numbers of
# alternate packages, allowing default and templated values. We generate another
# artifact from this one, called packages.lock which contains the fully expanded set
# of package and layer specs. This fully expanded file is in turn used to drive the
# build process, and as data for templating CI config.

# config contains packagespec config for this repo.
config:
  # product-repo is important to any CI providers.
  product-repo:          git@github.com:hashicorp/vault.git
  # product-id is used by external systems to identify this product.
  # It can be any unique name, buy a golang import path style string
  # is ideal.

# inputs are a set of environment variables that may affect the set of bytes produced
# for a given package. Note that a package is a zip file containing the binary, so
# the name of the binary does affect the package's bytes.

# packages is the full set of packages we are able to build based on a single commit
# in this repo. Each package is a map where the keys are the names of environment
# variables provided to each build (think 'go build' invocation). Each package is
# expanded by first filling in any unspecified variables with those from defaults,
# and then rendering each template and adding the result to the map.
# Each package must result in a unique PACKAGE_NAME.
#
# The fully expanded set of packages are written to packages.lock. That file
# is a useful data source for building CI/CD pipelines.

# meta contains additional metadata to pass into the build. This metadata does not

# Layers determines the build layers, which are individually cacheable layers
# in a linear build. Each layer contains a Dockerfile. All the layers
# together produce the final builder image used to compile binaries.
#
# The partial Dockerfiles may contain references to any of the inputs
# including rendered input templates, but may not reference meta data.
# These Dockerfiles, once rendered, count as inputs and affect the
# package spec ID of each package.
#
# The order of layers is significant. The first layer must have a FROM line, and
# forms the base image. Each subsequent layer begins from the previous one.
#
# You can control cacheability by careful use of variables and ordering.
# Try to group things which change infrequently towards the top, and
# things which change more frequently towards the bottom.
#
# If there are things you want to cache that vary between packages defined in
# this file, put them last so that the greater bulk of work can be shared.
#
# NOTE: At present, changing the names and/or adding/removing layers may
# require updating the CI template file at .circleci/config/@build-release.yml.tpl
# which references some of these layers by name.
